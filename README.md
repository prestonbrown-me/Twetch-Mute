## Why?
I made this Firefox extension because I'm tired of no mute feature. It is really poorly made. You get what you pay for. BUT. Gimme clout and donations.

## How?
1. visit annoying page ![annoying](./readme/unmuted-image.png)
2. mute user ![mute](./readme/muted-image.png)
3. their posts will now be hidden site-wide
4. there is a list of everyone you have muted as browser popup ![list](./readme/list.png)
5. to unmute user (why?) just go back to page and click the unmute button

## Contribute
I have very little experience with creating browser extensions. This is a work in progress that anyone can contribute to.

## FAQ
1. No chrome?
   - no. chrome needs to get it together and use promises like firefox provides with ```browser```
